Steps for running the storm test project:

1. Get the projet from reposotory.

2. Make sure all the jars from lib folder are also present.

3. Class path is already edited but still make sure all the jars are available in the build path, these jars does everything for storm and twitter
and tested for config.

4. Install Memcached on the system (either windows or linux or ubuntu), make sure it is running while running the test query code.

5. Check the port for Memcached, we are using memcached client jar to connect to memcache, we use "127.0.0.1" as IP address , it can be edited in
MemcachedServer class for connection.

6. Run the TestQuery class, you can edit the keyword which you want to search in Memcache and eventually wants to fetch from twitter if not present.

Here:------------------------------------
String keyword = "reservation";

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

7. These are twitter cerdentials to fetch the data in app, it is already set:

"Qy5b24hTUlM9PchKyp1rbnDOz",
					"GL78gicHGxZiBde4X02AMQOtj5uWQXCjQNLIR6h9A8zc7rhWA0",
					"3377235640-RPd7LvAHyV1RxtfKAkQjc7o8jXXFH0ocUa1Gym6",
					"5IHfMLjU5OOHRWUiZsu3gKPJDwD5rBePH85AXZDFN78TF",
					
8. The class searches the memcache, else fetches the data matching tuple from twitter and saves in Memcache, finally also gets the saved data 
to show.

9. Fetching the data is done by Twitter spout and saving in Memcache is done by Bolt, the all topology is deployed in local cluster.

Hope it helps, version with more functionality can be added and in progress, also a spring web app integration.
